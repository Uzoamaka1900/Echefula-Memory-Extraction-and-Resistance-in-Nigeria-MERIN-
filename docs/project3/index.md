# Project 3: ACAIREN Archive

Welcome to the **Anti-Erosion Campaign and Indigenous Resistance in Eastern Nigeria (ACAIREN)** Archive.

This archive documents the historical and contemporary struggles of communities in Eastern Nigeria against erosion, extractive development, and colonial land practices. Using oral histories, community maps, environmental reports, and resistance petitions, ACAIREN highlights how indigenous actors mobilized local knowledge and political action to defend their land and memory.

Explore petitions, archival fragments, and fieldwork data that trace anti-erosion resistance from the colonial period through the present day. The collection is grounded in participatory research, co-creation workshops, and spatial storytelling.
