# About the Collection

### Introduction

This collection, *Echefùla: Memory, Extraction, and Resistance in Nigeria (MERIN)*, investigates the complex interactions between colonial authorities and indigenous communities in Eastern Nigeria from 1915 to 1940, focusing on land acquisition and community resistance in resource extraction zones. Drawing from digitized petitions, engineering reports, oral histories, and colonial maps, the collection explores the enduring legacies of mining violence and land dispossession. It is grounded in archival materials and community memory work and forms part of Uzoamaka Nwachukwu’s dissertation research.

### Historical Background

#### Colonial Expansion and Land Dispossession

The colonial administration’s push to extract coal from the Enugu region in the early 20th century marked a turning point in Nigeria’s resource governance. The Crown Lands Ordinance enabled mass expropriation of indigenous land, justifying colonial infrastructural expansion and extraction.

#### Petitions as Tools of Resistance

In response, indigenous communities petitioned colonial administrators to reclaim lost land, contest legal injustices, and demand compensation. From the 1915 land protest of Chief Onyeama to 1930s petitions from Ngwo chiefs over unused crown lands, these materials offer a counter-archive of resistance.

#### Archival Methods and Digital Integration

The collection draws on archives in Enugu, Ibadan, Kaduna, and key UK repositories (Kew, Oxford, Bristol, Liverpool). It uses:

* Topic modeling (e.g., grievances, compensation, ecological degradation)
* GIS mapping (to visualize land conflict and spatial change)
* Interactive visualization (to engage users in understanding local perspectives on extraction)

### My Intervention

This project uses digital humanities tools to present and interpret community memory and environmental history from a bottom-up approach. It includes:

* The *CLAIRE* platform: [abandonedminesnigeria.github.io/CLAIRE](https://abandonedminesnigeria.github.io/CLAIRE)
* The *Communities and Mining in Nigeria* site: [communitiesandmininginnigeria.org](https://www.communitiesandmininginnigeria.org), which hosts the Mining Media Memory Map (1935–2025).

Key interventions:

* **Digitization of primary sources** (petitions, maps, oral histories)
* **Visualization tools**: timelines, word clouds, and maps
* **Community-engaged workshops** that co-create historical “memory maps”

The archive is built with CollectionBuilder and designed to honor the CARE and FAIR principles.

# About the Creator

Uzoamaka Nwachukwu is a doctoral researcher whose work sits at the intersection of environmental history, colonial extraction, and community memory. She applies GIS, metadata standards, and archival methods to create participatory knowledge infrastructures that document land, labor, and resistance histories. Her digital projects explore how African communities contest extractive afterlives and imagine just futures.

### Academic Expertise

* Environmental justice and memory studies
* Archival ethics and colonial governance
* Digital cartography and Indigenous knowledge

### Research Tools

* GIS spatial analysis
* Topic modeling and text mining
* Oral history transcription and thematic metadata design

### Vision

Echefùla contributes to global discussions on postcolonial environmental repair. By linking archival sources to present-day community testimony, it generates a living record of resilience in the face of resource exploitation.
