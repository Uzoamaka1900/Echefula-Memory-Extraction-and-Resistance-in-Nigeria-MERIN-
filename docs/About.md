# About the Collection

## Introduction

*Echefùla: Memory, Extraction, and Resistance in Nigeria (MERIN)* is a multi-sited digital archive that examines the entangled histories of colonial land acquisition, extractive violence, and indigenous resistance in Eastern Nigeria between 1915 and 1940. Through digitized petitions, engineering reports, oral testimonies, and colonial cartography, this collection reconstructs forgotten landscapes of contestation and ecological disruption. It is grounded in both archival evidence and collaborative community memory work and forms part of Uzoamaka Nwachukwu’s dissertation research.

## Historical Background

### Colonial Expansion and Land Dispossession

The early 20th-century extraction of coal in Enugu was facilitated by the Crown Lands Ordinance, which sanctioned massive alienation of indigenous lands under colonial rule. This legal mechanism enabled infrastructural growth while simultaneously dispossessing local communities of their ancestral territories.

### Petitions as Tools of Resistance

Petitions emerged as critical tools for indigenous resistance. From Chief Onyeama’s 1915 land protest to the 1930s legal challenges by Ngwo communities, petitioners documented injustice, demanded compensation, and reclaimed political agency. These texts offer a counter-archive that highlights subaltern voices in colonial governance.

### Archival Methods and Digital Integration

This project draws from archival repositories in Nigeria (Enugu, Ibadan, Kaduna) and the UK (Kew, Oxford, Bristol, Liverpool), employing:

- **Topic modeling** to extract themes such as grievances, compensation, and ecological degradation
- **GIS mapping** to visualize land conflicts, displacement, and spatial transformation
- **Interactive visualizations** to center local narratives and epistemologies of extraction

## My Intervention

Echefùla uses digital humanities tools to foreground bottom-up perspectives in environmental and social history. It is committed to accessible, participatory, and ethically-grounded knowledge production. Key platforms and tools include:

- **[CLAIRE](https://abandonedminesnigeria.github.io/CLAIRE)**: A community-based cartographic archive of abandoned mines and land memory
- **[Communities and Mining in Nigeria](https://www.communitiesandmininginnigeria.org)**: A participatory archive and home to the *Mining Media Memory Map (1935–2025)*

### Core Contributions

- **Digitization of primary sources**: petitions, maps, and oral histories
- **Visualization tools**: timelines, topic clusters, interactive maps
- **Community-engaged memory workshops**: participatory mapping and co-curation

This archive is built with CollectionBuilder and guided by the **CARE** and **FAIR** principles, prioritizing Indigenous data sovereignty, reuse, and transparency.

# About the Creator

Uzoamaka Nwachukwu is a historian and digital humanist whose research sits at the intersection of environmental history, extractive economies, and memory studies in Africa. Her work applies geospatial technologies, archival methods, and metadata curation to document contested landscapes and the lived afterlives of colonialism.

## Academic Focus

- Environmental justice and memory politics
- Archival ethics and colonial governance
- Digital cartography and Indigenous knowledge systems

## Research Tools

- GIS spatial analysis and historical mapping
- Text mining and topic modeling of archival materials
- Oral history collection and metadata design

## Vision

Echefùla offers a living record of resistance, reclamation, and resilience. By bridging historical documents with contemporary testimony, it contributes to global conversations on postcolonial environmental repair and the politics of remembering.
