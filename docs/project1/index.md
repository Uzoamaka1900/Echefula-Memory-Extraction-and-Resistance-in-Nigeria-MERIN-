# Project 1: CLAIRE Archive

Welcome to the **CLAIRE Archive** â€” *Colonial Land Acquisition and Indigenous Resistance in Enugu, 1915-2004*.

This collection explores how coal mining, land dispossession, and community displacement shaped Eastern Nigeria from the colonial period to the postcolonial present. CLAIRE maps out memory through crown land act, environmental impact records, and archival petitions to unearth narratives often buried beneath extractive infrastructures.

CLAIRE features:
- Digitized petitions and colonial land acquisition reports
- Interactive geospatial tools tracking claims and environmental harm
- Memory maps created with local communities

This project centers community voices in the ongoing reckoning with the afterlives of coal mining in Enugu and beyond.
