# Project 2: MMM Archive

Welcome to the **Mining Media Memory (MMM)** archive.

This archive documents how Nigeria's print media from 1935 to 2025 reportedâ€”or failed to reportâ€”on mining, labor, environmental degradation, and community resistance. Drawing on thousands of digitized articles and oral testimony, MMM reconstructs the historical memory and media silence around extraction.

MMM explores:
- Digitized and annotated newspaper reports
- Topic modeling of mining narratives
- Visualization of reporting frequency across time and space
- Interviews with journalists and mining-affected communities

Part of the *EchefÃ¹la* digital collection, this project aims to challenge silences, surface subaltern perspectives, and inspire new ways of understanding press archives as political memory.
