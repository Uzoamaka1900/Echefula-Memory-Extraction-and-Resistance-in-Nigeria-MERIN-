# Project 2: MMM Archive

Welcome to the **Mining Media Memory (MMM)** archive.

This digital collection curates newspaper reports, archival fragments, and community testimony to explore how media in Nigeria has documented, silenced, and reimagined mining and its afterlives. From 1935 to 2025, media has played a key role in shaping how extraction, labor, child rights, and environmental memory are framed and contested.

This archive includes:
- Annotated newspaper articles
- Topic modeling on mining-related terms
- A visual map of coverage zones and silences
- Interviews with journalists and affected communities

Mining Media Memory is part of a broader research initiative on extractive landscapes and archival silences in Nigeria.
