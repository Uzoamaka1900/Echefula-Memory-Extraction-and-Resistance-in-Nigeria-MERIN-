The Ngwo Council,
Ngwo.

Subject: Waterworks - Ngwo

I see that you desire to accept £6 a year rent, and that you demand £20. You asked to see me about this, and in accordance with a hint, which you gave me the last time I visited you, that I should come early, I arranged to meet the Council at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, 26th. I arrived at Ngwo about 9 a.m., but then found that only three Councilors had turned up.

When the question of rent was discussed with you in the presence of Captain Leeming on 19th June, 1941, you agreed that it was reasonable to put the value of the land at about 6d per acre. The Headworks area of the Waterworks, as government property, proposes to lease its poor land, and it is largely not capable of being farmed. The area is 247 acres, which gives an approximate value of £6.0 from the point of view of an annual compensation (which you did not want). £200 would have been ample compensation. This amount, at 3 percent, would have yielded £6 a year, which is the same figure as above.

Now, of course, in your usual way of never abiding by your previous word, you advance a request for 20 acres, which would put the value of the land at over £1/2 per acre, and this is manifestly absurd. You mention Aba, Port Harcourt, and Calabar. I do not know for certain where the sites in Aba or in Calabar are, but in Port Harcourt they are near the township and where land is naturally more valuable. In your case, the land is nowhere near the township, and it is poor land, even wholly being outside the main zone.

I will be glad to hear anything that you have to say, if you write soon.

Signed:
Resident - Q.P.
