His Honor,
The Resident,
Onitsha Province,

Your Honor,
Simeon Onyi and Ngwo Chiefs Petition for Rent

We have to acknowledge receipt of yours No. OP. 1867/285 of the 12th August last and in reply to state that in view of the judgement of the high court Enugu given in this matter last June at Enugu by Justice Jeffreys, your proposal of compensation amounting to 102 pounds (at 6 pounds a year) comes as a surprise to us. We see no reason why we should accept 6 pounds a year when the court after going round the matter on a writ of summons by Government and represented in court by the District Officer Udi, fixed payment at 15 pounds 10 shillings a year. We certainly do not accept this strange proposal, we claim to be entitled to payment in accordance to your judgement of the court to pay 263 pounds and 6 shillings  for the period 1st of January, 1926 to the 31st of December 1942 and a subsequent funds for 1943 for as long as Government needs the land
