Enugu District
23/2/1922

To- His Excellency,
Sir Clifford,
Governor of Nigeria
Lagos

Your Excellency,


We the undersigned Chiefs of Abaja Tribe of the Enugu District have the honor to approach his excellency on a matter which we consider we are not receiving sympathetic Consideration and which we trust your excellency pitiful observation will minimize it.

Although we are aware of the channels through which your excellency might be approached, but it is already stated that we are not receiving sympathetic consideration form almost the climax of such channels, hence we have taken the liberty of addressing your excellency directly

The subject of the petition in brief and not to waste a moment of your excellency precious time is to humbly as the government for the prerequisite in connection with the land at present occupied by them at Enugu

We do quite understand the fact of minerals being the property of the government and for which the present coal forms the  part. But what we mean to infer your excellency are the following-

1) The government having taken part of this land for its own use freely should allow us to make leases to firms and others direct as is done in other places such as Calabar, Onitsha etc

2) That having taken the direct leasing of coalfields should share the proceeds with us
3) That in the absence of this, we regard ourselves as not fairly treated

Perhaps we fail to make ourselves more lucid in our previous petition. When we had the opportunity of interviewing his honor, Lieutenant-Governor at Enugu on the 14th instant, he cited a case of hostilities at Udi and subsequently becoming a conquered territory, we beg to mention for his excellency's information that a place like Benin city had the same fate but we understand that they control their land to say nothing of the timbers.

We trust that your excellency would do something to abate the feelings at present prevailing.

We have-
