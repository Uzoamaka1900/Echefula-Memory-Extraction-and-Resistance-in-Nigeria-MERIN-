Acquisition of Land for Public Purpose
	I am directed to inform you that his honor has had under consideration for some time past the question of policy in regard to acquisition of land by government for public purposes. There have been many instances in recent years where the outright acquisition of land has been resisted by the people concerned in these cases the landowners are frequently nevertheless willing to make available the land required by the government on long term lease on reasonable conditions. In these circumstances it has proved to be a most undesirable policy on political grounds to press for outright acquisition

	His excellency has now instructed that while as a general rule is desirable to acquire land outright consideration should  in each case be given to the wishes of the native authority concerned and the later should only be over ruled in cases where the purpose for which the land is to be acquired renders outright acquisition imperative.

	I am to add that in cases where land is acquired under lease, the acquisition procedure set out in cap.88 should nevertheless be followed, unless conditions are such as that there is no possible doubt as to the title of the landowners and to their exclusive right to lease the land.
