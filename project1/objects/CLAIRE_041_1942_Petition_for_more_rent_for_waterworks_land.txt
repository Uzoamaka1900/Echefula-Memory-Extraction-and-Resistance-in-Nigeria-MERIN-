His Honor, the Resident,
Onitsha Province
Onitsha on tour at Udi
Sir,

Water Works-Ngwo

With reference to your memo No OP 1867/254 dated 17th September 1942. I am directed by the Ngwo council members to inform you that they will not accept the annual advance of 6 pounds for the waterworks-that they have told you that Government should be paying them 20 pounds per annum leasing a fair reasonable sum. But if not, that they have to point out to you that there are waterworks at the Port Harcourt, Calabar etc which are second class township like Enugu. If your honor mean to treat Ngwo reasonably the Ngwo should expect to receive the same average of advances paid to those people.

That before any agreement should be prepared and transfer of their signature they wish to see you for further discussion.

The typed agreement are returned herewith. 

I have the honor to be
Your obedient servant
