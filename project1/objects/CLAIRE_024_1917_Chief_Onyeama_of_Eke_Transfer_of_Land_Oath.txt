I, Chief Onyeama of Eke, make oath and say that I am the paramount Chief of the Abaja Tribe in the Udi Division of the Southern Province, that I was present as a consenting party to a Deed of Agreement signed by the Chiefs of the towns of Eke, Ngwo, Esusi and Abbaw in the said  Udi Division granting to Government certain lands at Enugu required for colliery and railway purposes.  That the land had been pointed out to the said Chiefs in my presence by J. S. Hayes Colliery manager, Enugu. That the chiefs who signed were the proper representatives of their towns and people to sign the agreement referred to.
That they did so willingly and of their own accord and in my presence acknowledged the receipt of  the sum of fifty pounds  to be deposited in favor of each of the said four towns in full payment of all compensation due or which may be due to them as stated in the agreement.

That this agreement was read and explained to them by Francis Okwudile of Onitsha.
