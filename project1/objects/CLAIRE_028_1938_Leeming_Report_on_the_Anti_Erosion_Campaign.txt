ANTI -EROSION MEASURES AT NGWO
From Abaja Native Authority Office Udi Division 
To- The Senior  Constable of Forests, Enugu Circle Enugu
14th of April, 1938
I have to Inform the Ngwo council that the sum of 90 pounds was allocated in the current estimate for anti-erosion measures in the forest reserve at Ngwo
Despite all efforts in the past 12 month to convince the council of the need for the anti-erosion measures, the  council stated that they were opposed to the idea and would not allow any forestry or agricultural officer on any of their lands for any purpose.
I pointed out that we had no design on their land and that they would benefit from the measures and they replied that such statements was previously made to them but they later found that their lands were included as part of the forest reserve or by the government as crown lands. They said they do not trust the forestry or agricultural officers  of the colony.

I explained the Udi project and  asked them to verify that we permitted Udi farmers to work on the land which had been rejuvenated by the anti-erosion measures 6-7 years ago. They countered by showing how we only allowed farmers to work on certain parts of the land showing that we had taken the land from Udi farmers
I suggest we give each farmer a title document to the land, they replied that they trusted neither us or our documents and said that they preferred their lands to be eroded away gradually and the gullies to be allowed to increase in size and area rather than to have forestry officers interfering with their ownership

In view of past history of Ngwo and its lands, I must confess to having sympathy with their attitude in spite of  its evident correctness.

Until, therefore I am able to inform you of a change of outlook on the part of the Ngwo's, I must request you to take no steps in regard to the anti-erosion measures in Ngwo. If necessary the 90 ponds allocated will have to lapse. The 270 pounds which is earmarked for the anti-erosion measures in the reminder of the Udi Forest reserve can of course be expended but it will be well to advise me first of any proposed measures to be undertaken elsewhere than in the immediate vicinity of Udi station, in order that I may explain the work to the land owners concerned.

Until this matter is resolved, I must request that no step be taken in regards to the anti-erosion measures
