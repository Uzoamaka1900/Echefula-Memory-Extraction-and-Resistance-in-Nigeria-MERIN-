Stephen and Others Response to the suggestion to acquire eroded areas to apply remedial measures

The district officer and acquisition office oppose this idea because of the trouble with Ngwo and others which was caused by government acquisition of far more lands that was needed by either the colliery or railway despite the fact that we have informed them that we are prepared to surrender unwanted areas. Granted that the land is being eroded but that does not mean we should acquire and completely deprive Ngwo of some more land-

The Ngwo's are already unfriendly in their attitudes towards an acquisition of the headwork piece

The position of government is that-
All land belongs to government and it can go on for ever making what use it likes of it, Govenment can go on using the township, scout camp and Obwette quite easily and thigs remain constant.  but if you want rent for these places and if you want to receive back all that land that I have shown you, then you must respond to the question i asked-
1. what is the name of the land
2. who are the owners, the proper people to make the deed and receive the rent
3. what do you think would be  a fair rate/ amount of rent

Without much doubt we decided that the name of the land is 'Iyi Akwa Okuku' and we decided to find the owner along the criteria of 
1. the whole of Ngwo (seven communities)
2. a quarter of Ngwo
3. a family
4. an individual

After this, the council requested to know what would happen to the farmland in the area not surrendered because in the township, farming land was granted to non ngwos and the council wanted to know if government will allow such people permit to farm whereever they wanted.

The farmland at issue is that small stripe bounded by the coal camp, the encampment, the agbani road and the police training school. The Ngow had raised the issue of Nike, Akegbe and others trespass into the forest reserve
