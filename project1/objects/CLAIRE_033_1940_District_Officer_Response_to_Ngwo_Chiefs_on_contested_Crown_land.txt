My dear Friends,
	You do not appear to have realized even yet the position with regard to crown land. All that land bounded by a line from the stone below the Rest house unto the quarter of Enugu, to the brook of Nsude, to Nyaba, to the Police training school and unto the railway bridge over the Asata, then along the Asata and past the chief commissioner's House to the Ekulu from there to the tall Hill behind the Iva's colliery and from there to the smaller hill and thus back to the rest house stone- all that land belongs to the government as the result of the 1915 and 1917 deeds and the money the government paid for it.
2	 Now situated inside the government's land are three things-
a. Enugu township
b. The scout camp
c. Obwette
	 They are on government land and government owes you nothing for them. but government has looked around and has seen that it does not require much of the land it owns and is prepared to give back to the owners those parts it does not want. Moreover in spite of the fact that Government has already bought the land, it is prepared to pay rent for the land it keeps . I have asked three simple questions for the Enugu township, the scout camp and Obwette land
a.	 What is the name of the land, 
b.	who are the owners
c.	what do you think will be a fair rent
	You have declined to to discuss those questions with me because you demand to know what is going to happen to farm land within the township. I repeat that the land belongs to government bought by government and that the owner can do as he likes with it while holding out no promise whatever. I suggest you think of government generous offer of surrendering land and paying rent and it may be that if government does not want the farm land you may be allowed to use it until Government does want it.
	 The position is that all that land belongs to government and it can go for ever making what use it it as it likes of it. Government can go on using Enugu township, the scout camp and Obwette easily and things remain as they are. But if you want rent for those places and if you want to receive back all that land, then you must decide to answer the questions i have asked.

Your good friend 
District Officer to Ngwo Council, Ngwo
