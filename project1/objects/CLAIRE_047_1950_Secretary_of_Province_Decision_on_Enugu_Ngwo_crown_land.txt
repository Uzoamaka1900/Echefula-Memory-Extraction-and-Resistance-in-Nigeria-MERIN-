From the Secretary Office,
Eastern Provinces, Enugu_Nigeria

The Resident,
Onitsha Province,
Onitsha

Crown Lands at Enugu

I am directed to refer to your letter N0. OP. 1367/373
of the 27th of March 1950 and to say in consequence of your letter No. OP 1867/370 of the 12th of October, 1949, a meeting was convened on the 17th of November 1949 by the assistant commissioner of lands in the office of the local 	Authority Enugu, at which were present your predecessor, the district officer, Udi division and regional heads of Department. You were no doubt supplied by the local authority with a minute of the meeting.

2. The meeting recommended to his honor-
a) That in view of its present and future requirements, government will be ill advised to divest itself of any land at Enugu at present vested in it but that there appears to be no objection to permitting Ngwo to farm under temporary occupation license such areas as were not at present being utilized by Government.
b) The cost for economic rent for the land at the date of acquisition have been 1d per acre per annum ie 71 pounds per annum for the 19000 acres comprising of the 1915 and 1917 acquisition
c) That not only Ngwo but other villages Abbaw, Nike, Ogwi. Akegbe and Nsudi had held rights  in the land and that they should share in any payment that should be made to Ngwo
d) That unless the former landowners should be made to understand and accept that they were not entitled to any share in present day land values, it would be better not to make any offer a sum which they might well look upon as derision
3. It is clear that the rent of 2000 pounds as rent per annum asked by the Ngwo people bears no relation to the rent their lands might have commanded in 1915 and 1917, the dates of the acquisition. It must be remembered that the Ngwo people held only a comparatively small portion of the 17000 acres then acquired and that of their land so acquired the greater part is steep hillside of little value for farming or building
4. His honor has directed accordingly that it would be pointless to pursue the matter further. It is clear that there is no loss that can be surrendered without jeopardizing future development and any variation of Government rights would result in the worst forms ...
5. I suggest therefore taht the Ngwo people should be informed that Government's offer was made in 1939 and then rejected and that his Honor is not prepared after a lapse of 10 years to reopen the matter.
