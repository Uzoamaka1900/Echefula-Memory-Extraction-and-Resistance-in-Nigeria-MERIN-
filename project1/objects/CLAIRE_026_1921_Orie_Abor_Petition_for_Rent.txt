Petition for Rent
From Orie Abor Meeting Place, 7th of March 1921
to the District Officer, Enugu Ngwo
sir,
In April 1920, we sent you a letter asking the government to pay us rent to the sum of 5000 pounds a year for our land and coal gotten from them in Enugu Division but up to present, we heard nothing on the subject.
We must here again state that the 250 pounds paid to four chiefs about four years ago was to compensate for timber required by the government colliery and not for land and coals gotten from the lands.
	We beg to request a reply be sent to us 
We are-
signed- Chief Ukwuani 		x	 for himself and people of Enugu, 
Ozo-Eze 					x  for Nsude
Ngwuagu					x for Abor
Nnadi					x for Ngwo
Onyeama					x for Eke
