Enugu Crown Land
 With reference to your letter no. 237/905 of the 11th of October, I am directed to input His Honor's comments on the following copy of the minute by the Commissioner of Lands-
'Land is acquired under Cap. 8 not only a)absolutely or b) for a term of years but alternatively, c)"for as long as it may be used for public purposes" (form A of schedule to Cap 88). In the schedule of Cap 112 laws 1908 there are two forms (D and E) of deed for use when land was acquired as in )c above and when compensation was paid either in lump sum or annually.

2. As regards the terms under which Enugu Aerodrome site was acquired, the S.E.P  informed me that the people who had an interest in this site "are adamant in their refusal to accept lump payment which they regard as involving sale of their land contrary to cherished customs". Though in that case, I supported the chief Commissioner's recommendation that an annual rent should be paid. I am now of the opinion that the acquisition of the water headworks site at Enugu for so long as it may be used as a waterworks site and the payment of a lump sum for the "rightsrights so acquired" would not only be more compatible with native custom than an absolute acquisition but also would give the Government precisely what it wants.
