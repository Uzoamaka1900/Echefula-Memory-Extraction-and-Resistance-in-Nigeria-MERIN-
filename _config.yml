description: "Multi-sited digital memory project documenting Nigeria’s mining and resistance histories"

About: "E-MERIN is part of my dissertation research work, it explores the layered histories and ongoing afterlives of mining in Eastern Nigeria. It brings together archival fragments, oral histories, petitions, media clippings, and maps to consider how communities navigate the ecological, social, and legal uncertainties left behind by extractive industries. The name Echefùla—“do not forget” in Igbo—grounds the project in a refusal to let these histories fade, particularly those shaped by displacement, dispossession, and resistance. Over the course of this research, I have been building a digital infrastructure that makes space for memory without reproducing extractive tendencies. Using a combination of open-source tools and community-centered methods, this site will host primary sources, content analysis, and metadata profiles that speak to broader themes like land loss, environmental degradation, forced labor, and post-mining survival. The platform also connects to my other digital initiatives—CLAIRE, a participatory mapping project on abandoned mine sites, and a media memory map of mining coverage from 1935 to 2025. I am in the process of developing the Anti-Erosion Campaign and Indigenous resistance in Eastern Nigeria Project. At this stage, visitors can browse select annotated materials and explore ongoing research questions. Additional modules, including a discussion space for researchers, community members, and students, are in development. Like the histories it gathers, Echefùla is still unfolding. The site’s “About” section includes background on the project’s formation, its digital architecture, and the ethical considerations guiding its design. Across all of its elements, this work aims to support a deeper reckoning with what mining has made—and unmade—across Nigeria’s landscapes and communities."
